# gooey

Harman's UI library made with React + TailwindCSS.

# getting started

## commands

```sh
yarn # required for installation
yarn storybook # starts up storybook
yarn build # builds
```

# status

This is still considered not ready for production, nor ready for use.

This is still serving as a playground on how I do tailwind and React.

# inspiration

- `gooey` will most likely at the end result look like [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).
- Most of the components are still rough and just obtained from [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) but tweaked slightly. It doesn't use the flowbite plugin, nor it is the representative of the full set. In fact, it will most likely diverge.
