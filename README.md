# gooey

Harman's UI library made with React + TailwindCSS.

# getting started

## commands

```
yarn
yarn dev - starts up storybook
yarn build - builds
```

# notes

## tailwind

i put tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js at the root. That works for storybook, but it may not work for building. Figure out what needs to be done there.
