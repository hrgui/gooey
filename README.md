This library is a playground for testing and learning on how I create UI components from end to end. It is not ready or meant for production use. It isn't well-maintained. Would prefer using libraries from `credits due` instead.

Harman's UI library made with React + TailwindCSS.

# Getting Started

## Commands

```sh
yarn # required for installation
yarn storybook # starts up storybook
yarn build # builds
```

# Inspiration

- `gooey` will most likely at the end result look like [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).
- Most of the components are still rough and just obtained from [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) but tweaked slightly. It doesn't use the flowbite plugin, nor it is the representative of the full set. In fact, it will most likely diverge.

# Credits Due

- [`flowbite`](https://flowbite.com/) for inspiration
- [`react-scrubber`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrubber) for providing ideas on how to implement a scrubber
